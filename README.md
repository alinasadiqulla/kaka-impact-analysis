# Kak√° Impact Analysis

An analysis of how Brazilian midfielder Ricardo Kak√°'s presence affected AC Milan's match outcomes using historical match data from the European Soccer Database.

## üìä Project Overview

This project analyzes AC Milan matches to determine whether Kak√°'s presence on the roster had a statistically significant impact on the team's performance and goal-scoring ability.

## üîç Key Findings

- **Correlation**: -0.011 (very weak correlation between Kak√°'s presence and goals scored)
- **T-Test Result**: P-value of 0.845 (no significant difference in goals with/without Kak√°)
- **Logistic Regression Accuracy**: 47.5% (limited predictive power using only Kak√°'s presence)
- The analysis suggests that using only a single player's presence is insufficient to predict match outcomes

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Python** - Data analysis and processing
- **SQL** - Querying the European Soccer Database (SQLite)
- **Pandas** - Data manipulation and analysis
- **Matplotlib** - Data visualization
- **scikit-learn** - Logistic regression modeling
- **Jupyter Notebook** - Development environment

## üìà Methodology

1. Connected to European Soccer Database (SQLite)
2. Filtered AC Milan matches from the Match table
3. Identified matches where Kak√° played by checking player IDs
4. Performed statistical analysis:
   - T-test to compare goals with/without Kak√°
   - Correlation analysis
   - Logistic regression for win prediction
5. Visualized results using bar charts
